Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: When I initialise a repository git probably creates an empty history file, the commit tree and other things. You need to do this to be able to use git with the files in that directory.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: The staging area is a transition space for commits, it allows us to see specifically what files are going to be commited. It offers control.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A: I can choose what files to put in the staged area, and I can check with diff if I want to commit exactly those changes, so it's up to me to check if the commit is going to contain one logical change. 

Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
A: Aside from the obvious branches allow the creation of checkpoints, points where you'd want to go in different directions. Branches allow a degree of fearlesness and also multiple people can work on multiple brancehs then merge them.
