Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: It is useful for team projects, and also it serves as a safe storage space, plus you get the benefit of working from multiple machines.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Because the remote repository can be edited by third parties, and you firstly would want to check what they did before integrating their code in your local project
